//Count of Subset Sum (hard)
/* Given a set of positive numbers, find the total number of subsets whose sum is equal to a given number āSā.

Example 1: #
Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=4
Output: 3
The given set has '3' subsets whose sum is '4': {1, 1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 3}
Note that we have two similar sets {1, 3}, because we have two '1' in our input.
Example 2: #
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}, S=9
Output: 3
The given set has '3' subsets whose sum is '9': {2, 7}, {1, 7, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 5}
Basic Solution

This problem follows the 0/1 Knapsack pattern and is quite similar to Subset Sum. The only difference in this problem is that we need to count the number of subsets, whereas in Subset Sum we only wanted to know if a subset with the given sum existed.

A basic brute-force solution could be to try all subsets of the given numbers to count the subsets that have a sum equal to āSā. So our brute-force algorithm will look like:

for each number 'i'
  create a new set which includes number 'i' if it does not exceed 'S', and recursively
      process the remaining numbers and sum
  create a new set without number 'i', and recursively process the remaining numbers
return the count of subsets who has a sum equal to 'S'

Code

Here is the code for the brute-force solution:*/
const countSubsets = function (num, sum) {
  function countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, currentIndex) {
    // base checks
    if (sum === 0) return 1;

    if (num.length === 0 || currentIndex >= num.length) {
      return 0;
    }

    // recursive call after selecting the number at the currentIndex
    // if the number at currentIndex exceeds the sum, we shouldn't process this
    let sum1 = 0;
    if (num[currentIndex] <= sum) {
      sum1 = countSubsetsRecursive(
        num,
        sum - num[currentIndex],
        currentIndex + 1
      );
    }

    // recursive call after excluding the number at the currentIndex
    const sum2 = countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, currentIndex + 1);
    return sum1 + sum2;
  }

  return countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, 0);
};

console.log(`Count of subset sum is: ---> ${countSubsets([1, 1, 2, 3], 4)}`);
console.log(`Count of subset sum is: ---> ${countSubsets([1, 2, 7, 1, 5], 9)}`);
/*
Time and Space Complexity


The time complexity of the above algorithm is exponential O(2^n)O(2
ān
āā ), where ānā represents the total number. The space complexity is O(n)O(n), this memory is used to store the recursion stack.

Top-down Dynamic Programming with Memoization

We can use memoization to overcome the overlapping sub-problems. We will be using a two-dimensional array to store the results of solved sub-problems. As mentioned above, we need to store results for every subset and for every possible sum.

Code

Here is the code:*/
const countSubsets = function (num, sum) {
  const dp = [];

  function countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, currentIndex) {
    // base checks
    if (sum === 0) {
      return 1;
    }

    if (num.length === 0 || currentIndex >= num.length) {
      return 0;
    }

    dp[currentIndex] = dp[currentIndex] || [];
    // check if we have not already processed a similar problem
    if (typeof dp[currentIndex][sum] === 'undefined') {
      // recursive call after choosing the number at the currentIndex
      // if the number at currentIndex exceeds the sum, we shouldn't process this
      let sum1 = 0;
      if (num[currentIndex] <= sum) {
        sum1 = countSubsetsRecursive(
          num,
          sum - num[currentIndex],
          currentIndex + 1
        );
      }

      // recursive call after excluding the number at the currentIndex
      const sum2 = countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, currentIndex + 1);

      dp[currentIndex][sum] = sum1 + sum2;
    }

    return dp[currentIndex][sum];
  }

  return countSubsetsRecursive(num, sum, 0);
};

console.log(`Count of subset sum is: ---> ${countSubsets([1, 1, 2, 3], 4)}`);
console.log(`Count of subset sum is: ---> ${countSubsets([1, 2, 7, 1, 5], 9)}`);
/* Bottom-up Dynamic Programming

We will try to find if we can make all possible sums with every subset to populate the array db[TotalNumbers][S+1].

So, at every step we have two options:

Exclude the number. Count all the subsets without the given number up to the given sum => dp[index-1][sum]
Include the number if its value is not more than the āsumā. In this case, we will count all the subsets to get the remaining sum => dp[index-1][sum-num[index]]
To find the total sets, we will add both of the above two values:

  dp[index][sum] = dp[index-1][sum] + dp[index-1][sum-num[index]])
Letās start with our base case of size zero:

'0' sum can always be found through an empty set

With only one number, we can form a subset only when the required sum is equal to the number

sum: 1, index:1=> (dp[index-1][sum] + dp[index-1][sum - 1])

sum: 2, index:1=> (dp[index-1][sum] + dp[index-1][sum - 1])

sum: 4, index:3=> (dp[index-1][sum] + dp[index-1][sum - 3])
1 1 0 0 0
1 2 1 0 0
1 2 2 2 1
1 2 2 3 3

let countSubsets = function (num, sum) {
  const n = num.length;
  const dp = Array(n)
    .fill(0)
    .map(() => Array(sum + 1).fill(0));

  // populate the sum=0 columns, as we will always have an empty set for zero sum
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = 1;
  }

  // with only one number, we can form a subset only when the required sum is equal to
  // its value
  for (let s = 1; s <= sum; s++) {
    dp[0][s] = num[0] == s ? 1 : 0;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < num.length; i++) {
    for (let s = 1; s <= sum; s++) {
      // exclude the number
      dp[i][s] = dp[i - 1][s];
      // include the number, if it does not exceed the sum
      if (s >= num[i]) {
        dp[i][s] += dp[i - 1][s - num[i]];
      }
    }
  }

  // the bottom-right corner will have our answer.
  return dp[num.length - 1][sum];
};

/*Time and Space Complexity

The above solution has the time and space complexity of O(N*S)O(NāS), where āNā represents total numbers and āSā is the desired sum.
Challenge

Can we improve our bottom-up DP solution even further? Can you find an algorithm that has O(S)O(S) space complexity?

Similar to the space optimized solution for 0/1 Knapsack!*/
